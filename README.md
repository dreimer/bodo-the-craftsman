# bodo-the-craftsman
Spice up your console outputs with a personalized message from your favourite imaginary human being: Bodo the Craftsman!

## Usage
```js
import "bodo-the-craftsman";

// Just print the image
console.bob();

// Print the image as well as a speech bubble
console.bob("Hello world!");

// Specify a variant of Bodo
console.bob("Hello world!", "angry");

Currently, there are two available variants: "regular" and "angry". If no variant is specified, a random one is picked based on predetermined probabilities instead.
